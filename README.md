This website has various sections with custom made images, designed by my self in (adobe photoshop), for each main catergories and subcatergories.
The main functionality for this website is a online clothing store that you can use on all devices to purchase items from, the website has a admin page,
that allows the admin to add more products and catergories when they are needed, deleted and edit products and catergories.
